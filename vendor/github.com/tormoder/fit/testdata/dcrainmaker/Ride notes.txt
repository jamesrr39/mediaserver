In St. John's, Newfoundland.

30 minute build, then 2 easy, then 2x20 @ 320w NP.  Slightly lower on the second set simply due to being downhill sections.

WASP data included - did see a WiFi dropout note, so while data would be aligned, if there's a full-drop in there, it's just the WASP unit to iPhone connection (the WASP didn't lose connectivity to ANT+ sensors).
